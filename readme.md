# Task Manager Application with Comprehensive Testing

*Application created with ChatGPT-4, overall subjective rating 4/10
## Overview

This repository hosts a streamlined **Task Manager Application** built with **React** and **Next.js**. The application focuses on robust software testing practices by integrating unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests using **Jest** and **Cypress**.

## Objectives    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},


- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a responsive, intuitive task management system.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement thorough unit, integration, and E2E tests to ensure code quality.
- **Data Persistence:** Leverage Next.js and browser `localStorage` for data persistence across sessions.
- **Modern Development Practices:** Utilize React and Next.js alongside Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build robust applications.

## Core Features

### Task Management
- **Add Tasks:** Create new tasks with a title and optional description.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify the title and description of existing tasks.
- **Toggle Completion:** Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Store tasks in `localStorage` to retain data after page reloads.

### User Interface
- **Clean & Intuitive Design:** A well-organized UI for efficient task management.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Action Controls:** Each task includes buttons for editing, toggling completion, and deletion.

### Optional Enhancements
- **Filtering:** Allow users to view all tasks, completed tasks, or pending tasks.
- **Sorting:** Enable sorting of tasks by creation date, due date, or completion status.

## Technology Stack

| **Component**           | **Technology**                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**            | React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript    |
| **Data Storage**        | Browser `localStorage`                              |
| **Unit Testing**        | Jest                                                |
| **End-to-End Testing**  | Cypress                                             |
| **Development Tools**   | VS Code, GitHub, Node.js                            |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Jest)
- Validate core functions: adding, editing, toggling, and deleting tasks.
- Test data persistence via integration with `localStorage`.

### Integration Testing
- Ensure React components and Next.js pages interact seamlessly.
- Verify that UI updates correctly in response to user actions.

### End-to-End Testing (Cypress)
- Simulate real user interactions throughout the application.
- Confirm that tasks persist between sessions and after page reloads.

## Development Methodology

This project adopts a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:
1. **Write Tests First:** Define test cases for all desired functionalities.
2. **Implement Features:** Develop features ensuring that all tests pass.
3. **Refactor:** Optimize the codebase while maintaining complete test coverage.

## Performance & Security Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize React rendering to efficiently handle at least 100 tasks.
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders and optimize DOM updates.

### Security & Privacy
- **Local Data Storage:** All data is stored on the client using `localStorage`, ensuring user privacy.
- **No Sensitive Data:** The application does not collect or transmit any sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The Task Manager Application, built with React and Next.js, provides a practical tool for daily task management while serving as a comprehensive learning resource for modern software testing practices. Through rigorous unit, integration, and E2E testing, the project demonstrates robust and maintainable development practices anchored in TDD.
